##Professional experiences##

###![enter image description here][2]
My **final degree's internship** was at **Doctissimo** on the year **2011**. It was my best experience so far. I had to create from (almost) scratch a **mobile version** of the famous doctissimo forum (On the 3 first website of France) . It would be at least as good as the iPhone App.

After studies of multiple technologies, different path, and made many prototypes, I took the **Single Page Application** (**SPA**)  pattern. 

I learn almost all my advanced skills on JavaScript during this project as I made a complete framework on top of  **Backbone.js / underscore.js / Zepto.js**.

2 month before the lunch date, the Web app was an exact copy of the iPhone app. It had the same look, was fast, and all functionality were available (even more because of the censorship of Apple).

In Two month, the app was tweaked and made original form the iPhone app in order to create a new experience. As a **SPA**., it was only static files with a REST WebService (Already here for the iPhone app).

The day we push it online, it made all iPhone visits, and went very well.

You can probably still see it from an iPhone or android device : http://m.doctissimo.fr (Not from a computer, or by tweaking your user-agent)

> * **Php** (for some prototypes)
> * **JavaScript**
>   * **Backbone.js**
>   * **underscore.js**
>   * **Zepto.js** (Jquery light-weight replacement for smartphone)
>   * **Sencha** (Prototype)
>   * Jquery mobile (Prototype)
>   * Dojo mobile (prototype)
> * SproutCore (Prototype)
> * **Dojo shrinkSafe** (JavaScript compression & optimisation)
> * **Jenkins** for **Continuous integration**

###![Berins][3]
From **2009** to **2011** I made a website with **drupal** for the Berins's **wax**. This time, i made all the job for **design** and **integration** on **CSS-HTML**. 

I made the logo on **photoShop** (inspired by real printed logo). I also made all print creation for aesthetic exhibitions (**3x4m Poster**, **Flyers**, **Product's "*menu*"**)

I also made some illustrations pictures you can see on the website. 

> * **Php** (Drupal)
> * **Linux** Hosting
    * **Apache** - **Nginx**
    * **Bind9 DNS** for domain berins.fr
> * **PhotoShop** for the Logo and website pictures
> * **My Camera** for all Pictures of illustration

----------------
###![Institut de REcherche scientifiques sur les Boissons (IREB)][4]
From **2009** - **2010** I made the website of the association. Still online , it is **drupal** based. This version replaced a very old website updated by ftp with dreamweaver. 

Drupal made possible to give more autonomy to update the website. 

I had to search a Content Managemnt System that fit needs.

 * Multi-language
 * Fully web manageable
 * Easy enough for non tech people

After the work done, I had to write all documentation. User guide and Administration guide. With two servers fully installed for this purpose, i had to write how it was installed. This was very important for future people. Actually, I'm the one that still manage servers. But I only make one maintenance a year if required. No big trouble since the initial deployment ;-) 

I also refreshed the logo by making a new version for the website.

> * **Php** (**Drupal way**)
> * **Bash** & Scripting for servers **installations**, **sync** and **backup**
> * **Bind9 DNS** configuration (for **ireb.com** & **ireb.fr**)
> * **Mail** server configurations (**Google apps**)
> * **Mysql** for database (With multi master replication)
> * **PhotoShop** for the new logo

---------------

###![Padeleon][5]
From **2008** to **2010** I work for Padeleon 2 day a week. Other days were reserved to my school.

My main job was to implement new functionality on the product. It was a web application in the form of a **Single Web Application** (**SWA**) with **PHP** and **JavaScript**.

>   * **Php** (*the old fashion way* then object oriented)
>   * **JavaScript** standalone then with **Dojo**

--------------

###![IN-SNEC][6]

From **2007** to **2009**, I work for the leader of electronic for Aerospace and Satellite communication. In **internship** I was studying network and development at school and working at IN-SNEC schedule being a one-week rotation.

I was in the **IT department**, and it was my first real job. 

My most important project was a to replace a very old document management solution by a new one. I had to do everything. From the qualification of needs, to the validation with the client (Internal department)

The application required to migrate data from an old database called **sybase9** on a very old *SUN* computer.

When the need was correctly defined, I made teh application as a website. It was connected to the **Active directory** for user management, and all previous data were imported.

Technologies used were :
>   * **php** (*The old fashion way*)
>   * **PostgresQL** for the database
>   * **HTML-CSS** for the interface with AJAX (IE4.3 compatible. Yes it is possible !)
>   * **Bash** for migrations scripts and Installations scripts
>   * **Word** for the **user guide** and **Administrator guide**
>   * **Linux** for the system (**Debian 3 sarge**)
