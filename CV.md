## Skils & knowledge ##

###Devlopement ###
As a developer, I like coding. I really like the WEB and all related matters. I'm convinced the web is the future event if some think apps are better and will stay like this. 

**I make promotion of all development methodology that invite the developer to think & test before the first line of code : TDD, BDD, DDD, ...**
 
>  * Development in any language (Learning the language is required but dev is almost the same whatever is the language)
>  * PHP
>  * Usual Object Oriented Programing (OOP) **Design patters**
>  * Javascript
>  ** NodeJs
>  ** Mobile
>  ** CofeeScript
>  * TDD & BDD( Behat, cucumber, protractor)

---------------

### Industrialisation and automation ###
For me, development of medium to big project require rules and boundaries. The Continuous integration allow rules to be followed without the need to run each validation manualy.
It also show clearly where and why there is violations. During my career, I had to setup tools for Continuous integration and teach/explain to developers and manager how to read/use it as well as explain the usefulness of it.

Tools that calculate metrics or coverage are often wrongly used. All metrics that wecan have on code is usefull to find where our code need attention, but I thinks it's a helping tool, not a blocking tool.

> * Bamboo (Tool of Atlasian for Continuous integration)
> * Jenkins 
> * Continuous devlivery/deployment
> * Quality metrics (phpmd, phpcs, phpcpd, ...) with good usages. 
> * Dashboards (Dashing, AppDynamics, Kibana)

---------------

### System ###
Even if I am a developer, I like managing servers and setup networks. I don't have my hand in Cisco hardware often, but I like knowing how stuff works.
I'm comfortable using windows and linux as dev environment, and I can easily work on linux server side. I'm capable of setup all major tools used in web starting from Web servers to Database like Mysql or PostgreSql.
Now, I am using docker a lot, and it make configuration simpler for many of theses things. 

** I am a Developer with a little part of "OPS" in me.** part of my studies where network oriented because I already knew the development side. I wanted to know more on the network side of the force :-)

> * Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Centos & Redhat)
> * Nginx, Apache
> * Php FCGI & FPM
> * OpenVpn
> * Active Directory and Open Ldap
> * AppDynamics
> * Docker (Docker-compose,swarm,docker-machine)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

##Personal & public project I'm proud of##

**All my relevant tools and code is not in my personal Github space. It's located in the organisation : Riper, https://github.com/RiperFr **

My personal space on Github is more like a scrapbook for code. You will probably find useful stuf, but mostly, it's not really interesting.

##Professional experiences##

###![Meetic][7]
Since **2011**, I am working on the evolution and refactoring of the N°1 dating web site in europe. Meetic is born in france, but is now leader in all the europe with brands like Match, Lexa, Friend scout, Neu, ...

First, I integrated Meetic as simple developer in a **SCRUM** team. I worked on new features on the web site and also enhances previous features.

> * PHP4 with PHP4 interpreter :-) 
> * SCRUM Methodology
> * Team working (Tester, Integrator, Scrum Master and Developers) 

Then, I quickly integrated the **CORE**. SCRUM was done for me at this time because projects are not the sames. They are with multiple teams, and does not require work on regular basis. 
I actively participate in the creation of new development process related to the new architecture in preparation. 

The new architecture is based on the SOA principle. SOA stand for **"Service Oriented Application"**. THe main goal is to make the entire platform easy to update, upgrade and modify. 
The starting point is a php4 monolithic application that need to be cut and re-worked.

I participate in creation of Proof of concept that allowed us to know which of the following framework was best suited : Symfony2, Silex, Zend Framework 2. Symfony2 was selected.

I had to teach, to french developers at meetic, Object oriented programing in order to make them ready to work on Symfony2. During the formation I had to teach some design patterns and the general usefulness of them.
I had to explain the new Continuous integration process and all meaning of metrics we were using. And to finish, TDD (Test Drive Development) was a challenge too.

> * Design 
>   * UML Diagrams with * Astah*
>   * REST contract definitions
> * Test Driven Development methodology (TDD)
> * Usual Design patterns commonly used in Symfony2
> * Pedagogy 

In parallel, I also setup all the Continuous integration chain. First with Bamboo, for deployment and JIRA integration, then with jenkins for the dev continuous integration. Jenkins made possible things tha were not with Bamboo. 

After few month, I integrated the "Quality & industrialisation" service newly created in Meetic. I was full time on Industrialisation matters and promotions of quality in early stage of development.
I setup all theses tools & methodology  :

  * Gitlab
  * Jenkins
  * Bamboo
  * Home made tools for dev deployment
  * TDD, BDD wiht Phpunit, Behat & Protractor
  * Phpmd, phpcs, phpmetrics, ...
  * Docker for automated testing purposes. 
  
 
Here a sumary of what I will remember from Meetic :

> * Extraordinary peoples
> * Php
>   * Phing
>   * Phpunit
>   * phpcs, phpmd, phpcpd, phpmetrics, ...
> * Symfony2
> * REST web services
> * Dispensing training and helping others
> * UML (Mostly Class & sequence diagrams)
> * Continuous integration & continuous delivery  (Setup & usage) 
> * Bamboo, Jenkins
> * Git & Gitlab
> * Capistrano



###![Doctissimo][2]
My **final degree's internship** was at **Doctissimo** on the year **2011**. It was my best experience so far. I had to create from (almost) scratch a **mobile version** of the famous doctissimo forum (On the 3 first website of France) . It would be at least as good as the iPhone App.

After studies of multiple technologies, different path, and made many prototypes, I took the **Single Page Application** (**SPA**)  pattern. 

I learn almost all my advanced skills on JavaScript during this project as I made a complete framework on top of  **Backbone.js / underscore.js / Zepto.js**.

2 month before the lunch date, the Web app was an exact copy of the iPhone app. It had the same look, was fast, and all functionality were available (even more because of the censorship of Apple).

In Two month, the app was tweaked and made original form the iPhone app in order to create a new experience. As a **SPA**., it was only static files with a REST WebService (Already here for the iPhone app).

The day we push it online, it made all iPhone visits, and went very well.

You can probably still see it from an iPhone or android device : http://m.doctissimo.fr (Not from a computer, or by tweaking your user-agent)

> * **Php** (for some prototypes)
> * **JavaScript**
>   * **Backbone.js**
>   * **underscore.js**
>   * **Zepto.js** (Jquery light-weight replacement for smartphone)
>   * **Sencha** (Prototype)
>   * Jquery mobile (Prototype)
>   * Dojo mobile (prototype)
> * SproutCore (Prototype)
> * **Dojo shrinkSafe** (JavaScript compression & optimisation)
> * **Jenkins** for **Continuous integration**

###![Berins][3]
From **2009** to **2011** I made a website with **drupal** for the Berins's **wax**. This time, i made all the job for **design** and **integration** on **CSS-HTML**. 

I made the logo on **photoShop** (inspired by real printed logo). I also made all print creation for aesthetic exhibitions (**3x4m Poster**, **Flyers**, **Product's "*menu*"**)

I also made some illustrations pictures you can see on the website. 

> * **Php** (Drupal)
> * **Linux** Hosting
    * **Apache** - **Nginx**
    * **Bind9 DNS** for domain berins.fr
> * **PhotoShop** for the Logo and website pictures
> * **My Camera** for all Pictures of illustration

----------------
###![Institut de REcherche scientifiques sur les Boissons (IREB)][4]
From **2009** - **2010** I made the website of the association. Still online , it is **drupal** based. This version replaced a very old website updated by ftp with dreamweaver. 

Drupal made possible to give more autonomy to update the website. 

I had to search a Content Managemnt System that fit needs.

 * Multi-language
 * Fully web manageable
 * Easy enough for non tech people

After the work done, I had to write all documentation. User guide and Administration guide. With two servers fully installed for this purpose, i had to write how it was installed. This was very important for future people. Actually, I'm the one that still manage servers. But I only make one maintenance a year if required. No big trouble since the initial deployment ;-) 

I also refreshed the logo by making a new version for the website.

> * **Php** (**Drupal way**)
> * **Bash** & Scripting for servers **installations**, **sync** and **backup**
> * **Bind9 DNS** configuration (for **ireb.com** & **ireb.fr**)
> * **Mail** server configurations (**Google apps**)
> * **Mysql** for database (With multi master replication)
> * **PhotoShop** for the new logo

---------------

###![Padeleon][5]
From **2008** to **2010** I work for Padeleon 2 day a week. Other days were reserved to my school.

My main job was to implement new functionality on the product. It was a web application in the form of a **Single Web Application** (**SWA**) with **PHP** and **JavaScript**.

>   * **Php** (*the old fashion way* then object oriented)
>   * **JavaScript** standalone then with **Dojo**

--------------

###![IN-SNEC][6]

From **2007** to **2009**, I work for the leader of electronic for Aerospace and Satellite communication. In **internship** I was studying network and development at school and working at IN-SNEC schedule being a one-week rotation.

I was in the **IT department**, and it was my first real job. 

My most important project was a to replace a very old document management solution by a new one. I had to do everything. From the qualification of needs, to the validation with the client (Internal department)

The application required to migrate data from an old database called **sybase9** on a very old *SUN* computer.

When the need was correctly defined, I made teh application as a website. It was connected to the **Active directory** for user management, and all previous data were imported.

Technologies used were :
>   * **php** (*The old fashion way*)
>   * **PostgresQL** for the database
>   * **HTML-CSS** for the interface with AJAX (IE4.3 compatible. Yes it is possible !)
>   * **Bash** for migrations scripts and Installations scripts
>   * **Word** for the **user guide** and **Administrator guide**
>   * **Linux** for the system (**Debian 3 sarge**)
